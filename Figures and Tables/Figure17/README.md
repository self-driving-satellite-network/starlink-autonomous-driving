### Overview
Figure 17 shows orbital decay’s impacts on 1,000 randomly distributed inter-satellite network traffic flows.
This figure is to illustrate orbital decay will impact on upper network function.


### Experimental methodology
Our experiments are based on Two-line elements from space-track.org.


### How to run the code
```
jupyter notebook
open figure17.ipynb file and run notebook
```
