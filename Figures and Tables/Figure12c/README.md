<div align=center><img src="./figure12c.png" width=""></div>

### Overview
Figure 12c shows orbital decays around Iridium.
This figure is to illustrate how Iridium and other space objects' orbit change when they don't maintain their orbit. 


### Experimental methodology
Our experiments are based on Two-line elements from space-track.org.


### How to run the code
```
jupyter notebook
open figure12c.ipynb file and run notebook
```

### Data
The data can be found in the `figure12c/` folder.
